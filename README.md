Short URL Microservice
======================

this takes a url as part of the url input string and returns  
 a json object with the original url and the shortened url
 
 Similar to tinyurl
 
 the links between the two urls are stored in a mongodb
 with keys
 
 original_url
 short_url
 
 if the short url is submitted, the user is redirected to the original url
